## Features and improvements

### Deletion of factory functions suffixed by `OrNull` and `OrThrow`

We've removed the **experimental** factory functions suffixed by `OrNull` and
`OrThrow` for redesigning the provided ways to create our types.

If you were using these factory functions, we recommend use to use their stable
equivalent that doesn't have a suffix.

Here's an example for the `PositiveInt` type:

```kotlin
// Before
1.toPositiveIntOrNull()
2.toPositiveIntOrThrow()
// After
1.toPositiveInt().getOrNull()
1.toPositiveInt().getOrThrow()
```

### Documentation

The documentation was improved by supporting versions [4.1.0], [4.0.1], [4.0.0],
[3.2.0], [2.0.0], and [1.3.1] in the [API reference].

We've also created documentation files accessible from the
[README][README docs], including our security policy, versioning strategy and
declarations lifecycle.
