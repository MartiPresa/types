## New features and improvements

### New type converters suffixed by `OrNull` and `OrThrow`

We've introduced **experimental** type converters that, in case of a failure,
should return `null` if it's suffixed by `OrNull`, or should throw an exception
if it's suffixed by `OrThrow`.
Suffixing explicitly the type converters improves the overall readability and
the predictability of the API.

These type converters were added for the following types:

- `NonZeroInt`
- `PositiveInt`
- `NegativeInt`
- `StrictlyPositiveInt`
- `StrictlyNegativeInt` (thanks to [@o-korpi])
- `StrictlyPositiveDouble`
- `NotBlankString`
- `NotEmptyList`
- `NotEmptySet`
- `NotEmptyMap`.

Here's an example for the `StrictlyPositiveInt` type:

```kotlin
var firstResult: StrictlyPositiveInt?
var secondResult: StrictlyPositiveInt
// before
firstResult = 1.toStrictlyPositiveInt().getOrNull()
println(firstResult) // 1
secondResult = 2.toStrictlyPositiveInt().getOrThrow()
println(secondResult) // 2
// after
firstResult = 1.toStrictlyPositiveIntOrNull()
println(firstResult) // 1
secondResult = 2.toStrictlyPositiveIntOrThrow()
println(secondResult) // 2
```

### Better source compatibility with [Kotlin]

In this new version, we've improved the source compatibility with [Kotlin] by
supporting its versions 1.5 through 1.7.

Please note that since [Kotools Types 4.3.0], this project is compiled with
[Kotlin 1.7.21] by default.

[Kotools Types 4.3.0]: https://github.com/kotools/types/releases/tag/4.3.0
[Kotlin 1.7.21]: https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.7.21

### Documentation fix

We've also fixed a little typo in the documentation of the `notEmptyRangeOf`
function.
