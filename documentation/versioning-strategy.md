# üîÇ Versioning strategy

For versioning Kotools Types, we have a pragmatic approach based on the concept
of [backward compatibility].

## ü§î Types of compatibility

We focus on three types of compatibility:

- **Behavioral compatibility** ensures that new code doesn't change the behavior
  of existing one.
- **Source compatibility** ensures that client's code recompile correctly
  against a newer version of Kotools Types.
- **Binary compatibility** ensures that a newer version of Kotools Types can
  replace a previously compiled version of this library.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Stable API

With these types of compatibility in mind, here are the different types of
release that we ship for the stable API of Kotools Types:

- **Patch releases (`X.Y.Z`)** that can break the **behavioral compatibility**
  for fixing bugs, but the **source compatibility** and the
  **binary compatibility** should be preserved.
- **Minor releases (`X.Y`)** that can break the **behavioral compatibility**
  for fixing bugs and the **source compatibility** for deprecating declarations,
  but the **binary compatibility** should be preserved.
- **Major releases (`X`)** that can break the **behavioral compatibility**
  for fixing bugs, the **source compatibility** for deprecating declaration, and
  the **binary compatibility** for removing declarations.

## üß™ Experimental API

We also ship an experimental API of Kotools Types for trying out ideas and
collecting feedbacks from users.
This API includes all declarations marked with the `ExperimentalKotoolsTypesApi`
annotation requiring an explicit [opt-in].

Please note that this API doesn't have the same compatibility policy as the
stable one: ***experimental changes can break any type of compatibility in
any type of releases listed above***!
