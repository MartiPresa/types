## ðŸš§ Unreleased

### Added

  [#414](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/414)).
- The following **experimental** factory functions:
  - `create(Any?)` and `createOrNull(Any?)` in `NotBlankString.Companion` (issue
    [#341](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/341))
  - `create(Number)` and `createOrNull(Number)` in
    `StrictlyPositiveInt.Companion` (issue
    [#342](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/342)), in
    `StrictlyNegativeInt.Companion` (issue
    [#347](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/347)), in
    `PositiveInt.Companion` (issue
    [#349](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/349)), in
    `NegativeInt.Companion` (issue
    [#350](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/350)), and in
    `NonZeroInt.Companion` (issue
    [#351](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/351))
  - `create(Collection<E>)`, `createOrNull(Collection<E>)` and `of(E, vararg E)`
    in `NotEmptyList.Companion` (issue
    [#352](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/352)) and in
    `NotEmptySet.Companion` (issue
    [#353](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/353))
  - `create(Map<K, V>)`, `createOrNull(Map<K, V>)` and
    `of(Pair<K, V>, vararg Pair<K, V>)` in `NotEmptyMap.Companion` (issue
    [#354](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/354)).
- Documentation of dependency compatibility (issue
  [#288](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/288)).

### Changed

- Bump embedded Kotlin from 1.7.21 to 1.8.22 (issues
  [#172](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/172) and
  [#196](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/196)).
- Bump kotlinx.serialization from 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 (issues
  [#378](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/378) and
  [#381](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/381)).
- Move the `EmailAddress` **experimental** type from the
  `kotools.types.experimental` package to the new `kotools.types.web` one (issue
  [#377](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/377)).
- Make the `regex` property of the `EmailAddress` **experimental** type
  inaccessible for Java sources, due to the unavailability of the
  `kotlin.text.Regex` type for this language (commit
  [8d0d098ad](https://github.com/kotools/types/commit/8d0d098ad)).
- Update the regular expression of the `EmailAddress` **experimental** type for
  following the
  [RFC-5322](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1)
  (issue [#394](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/394)).
- Update our Git commit messages convention using
  [Gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji) in the contributing
  guidelines (issue [#490](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/490)).

### Deprecated

Deprecation promotion of the following annotations to error (issue
[#333](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/333)):
- `ExperimentalCollectionApi`
- `ExperimentalNumberApi`
- `ExperimentalRangeApi`
- `ExperimentalResultApi`
- `ExperimentalTextApi`

### Security

Upgrade follow-redirects to 1.15.4 on Kotlin/JS platform because prior versions
are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to the improper handling of URLs
by the `url.parse()` function (issue
[#375](https://github.com/kotools/types/issues/375)).
See the [security report](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jchw-25xp-jwwc) for
more details on this vulnerability.
